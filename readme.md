# TITOFY- (Open Innovation)


## Problem Statement:

During this quarantine we all are looking for the slightest of interaction. With very less chances of going out , it is improbable to meet new people. 
Moreover, the concept of meeting new people through the various meeting apps for today has become bleak.
As it is said, “first impression is the last impression” , half of the meeting apps tend to be a disaster for people who think they do not look good enough & are not socially confident. Nowadays, the factors on which people get matched are still not viable. 

## Problem Solution

Our app “Titofy” app proposes to solve all these issues. We plan on matching people on the basis of their music taste by checking their playlists.
It is rightly said –
“ You can tell a lot about a person from their playlist”.
Now with this, you can match up with your future forever-after partners & get to know them better. Consider the matching up scheme as an ice-breaker, as the compatibility of songs for both parties will be high.

## Abstract
This is an app based project that aims to match up people of all ages based on their music taste.
